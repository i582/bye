Greetings to the documentation for bye. Let's start with the installation.

```bash (install.sh)
# If you have the `Golang` toolbox, you just need to run the following command to install:
$ go get github.com/i582/bye
...
```

Otherwise, please download the required version from the [releases](https://github.com/i582/bye/releases).

After successful installation, let's go to the beginning of use.
